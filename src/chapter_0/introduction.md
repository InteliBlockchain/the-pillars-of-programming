Welcome to _The Pillars of Programming_

### Why this book exists
This book began as a course and evolved into a unique experience. Written by two lazy university students who love technology and are tired of all the bullshit in tech, it’s here to show you that computers can do far more interesting things than hard calculations, and programmers can do more than just web development; there is an infinite world of possibilities for what you can create.

### Who this book is for
The reader should have some previous experience developing computer programs, this book doesn't start from absolutely zero, and it's important that you have some knowledge of what are variables, control flows, functions, conditionals, etc.
</br>

Mathematics isn't a major topic of this book, but to surprise you, computers "speak" math. We'll use many mathematical notations to prove certain propositions or demonstrate ideas.

</br>
However, in general, this was meant for:

- Programmers seeking to go beyond the basics.
- Curious nerds.

### Goals
This book was written with one goal in mind, which is:

- Turn the reader into a stinking nerd

### How to use this book
The book assumes you're reading it in sequence from front to back. Later chapters build on concepts from earlier chapters, and chapters might not delve into profound details on a particular topic, but will always try to keep references to them.
</br>
As a general guideline, here's some pragmatic advice on how to use this content:

- Read the book at your own pace.
- It is highly incentivised for the reader to search way beyond what the book has to offer.
- Be open-minded, free yourself from any closed paradigm (objects are just data structures, don't treat them as religion).
- Write your version of code from examples.
- Have fun.
